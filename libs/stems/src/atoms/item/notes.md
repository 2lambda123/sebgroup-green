- Code: Begin with a text/input/whatever field that contains all necessary elements.

- Design: Create lists that complete the fields with all required components.
  We have agreed on a list-item that includes all necessary elements. However, in Figma, we have created “templates” for dropdown/input select. We should name them appropriately for future reference, such as “input/role” and “list-item/role”.

- Use the aria role to name fields
