Chlorophyll is the design token and css part of Green. It is used in all high level component libraries. If you are not useing a framework, you can use chlorophyll directly to style your `html`.

## Install

## Use

The Green design system has an unrelenting focus on sensible defaults and ease of use. All you have to do to start using it is import the css, mark the area in which you intend to start using Greem (use the `html` tag if the whole application uses it), and add the class `green`.

All your basic styling will now be correct. Additional classes will only be needed when you want to deviate from the defaults. So this:

```html
<div class="green">
  <h2>This is a pretty form</h2>
  <form>
    <label for="pretty-first-name">First name</label>
    <input name="firstName" id="pretty-first-name" />
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </form>
</div>
```

...will look like this:
