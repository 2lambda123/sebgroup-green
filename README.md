Green is an opinionated design system for building content and functionality for SEB. It builds on a set of principles and techniques aimed at maximizing code quality, code reuse, consistency and collaboration.

## Philosophy

Dream big! Start small! Learn fast!


### We only build what we need

If no-one needs a component, we will not build it. If someone needs a component, we will build it. This means that some things in Design Library might not make it into Green. It all depends on what gets used.


### Ease of use, not ease of build

The components of Green will be used more times than one. This puts a multiplier on the value of every hour spent improving ease of use.


### Minimum possible flexibility, but _not_ less

Flexibility means decisions must be made. This puts strain on every user of a system. Green goes the other way: Minimum flexibility, maximum clarity. If our users cannot do what they need, we solve that specific problem in a generalized way - no more, no less. Remember: The most flexible system possible is your terminal.


### We don't solve problems we do not have

If something _might_ be a performance problem, that is ok. If something _might_ give a to large payload, that is ok. When we suspect a problem, we measure it. If it _is_ a problem, we fix it. See [premature optimization](https://xkcd.com/1691/)


### We work from right to left

If something can be deployed, we deploy. Then, if a PR needs a review, we review. Then, and only then, if something can be built, we build. Flow is more important than speed.


## The design process

Green is tightly integrated with the design process. The design responsible are part of the team so that decisions can be made effectively and by those most suited.

For the most part we follow the existing design. When changes have to be made for practical reasons, clarity, uniformity, accessibility or any other reason, the design responsible make the call and the change is integrated.

This can, and will, lead to minor inconsistencies in different parts of our offering, especially as Green is not yet (even close to) at 100% adoption. This is fine. Far larger inconsistencies already exist in our current, digital ecosystem. We therefore prioritise the ability to keep moving forward and improve our customers' experience over delaying for the sake of consistency.

In the long run, consistency will be achieved by automating the roll-out of changes, be they visual, functional or qualitative, to keep all parts of our offering on the latest version. When we go Green, we stay green.


## Develop

### Yarn

This mono repo is based on `nx` and uses `yarn` instead of `npm`. If you are unused to yarn, see the following instructions:

#### Install yarn

```bash
npm install yarn -g
```
Use the -g flag to install it globally on your computer.


#### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

#### Add a dependency to a workspace

All projects use a common set of dependencies so if you want to add `leftpad` to the chlorophyll project, just run:

```bash
yarn add leftpad
```

#### Run a command in `package.json`

Unlike `npm`, `yarn` doesn't require the `run` command. So if you want to run `lint` in your package or in the project root, simply type:

```bash
yarn lint
```

### How to contribute?

- Clone the project locally from GitHub - `git clone https://github.com/sebgroup/green.git`.
- Create a new branch each time - `git checkout -b "DESCRIPTIVE NAME"`.
- Commit with the Semantic everything inscructions underneath.
- Pull the latest - `git pull`.
- Push eveything - `git push`.
- Make a pull request in GitHub - `https://github.com/sebgroup/green/compare`.

### Semantic everything

All projects in Green use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to power [semantic releases](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/). In order to simplify using this format, install:

```bash
npm install git-cz -g
```

To commit, just run `git-cz` in the terminal. Always try to add reference to an issue in the longer description with # and the issue number. Eg `#1337`. 

### Start Storybook

You start the common storybooks with these commands:

```bash
npx nx run chlorophyll:storybook
npx nx run react:storybook
npx nx run angular:storybook
```

Or the general `npx nx run [PROJECT]:storybook` where you replace `[PROJECT]` with a folder name from `green\libs`.

If you install nx globally you can omit the npx above.

```bash
npm install nx -g
```

#### Build

If you want to build the files to see how the output looks use `build-storybook`:

```bash
npx nx run chlorophyll:build-storybook
npx nx run react:build-storybook
npx nx run angular:build-storybook
```

### On SEB Windows computer

These are just an intermediate fixes to turn of security. Should be solved for real later on with certificate/proxy changes.

#### VPN

Yarn support for our artifactory will be supported later on, but for now you need to logoff the VPN (right click the lock symbol in the tray).


#### Proxy

Also if push fails, uncomment (with `;`) proxy settings in `C:\Users\%Username%\.npmrc`.
Then use:
```cmd
strict-ssl=false
https-proxy=null
proxy=null
```

#### SSL certificate problem

If you get `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate` you can try:

```cmd
SET GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true
git config --global http.sslVerify false
yarn config set strict-ssl false --global
```

## Release

Currently, beta releases are published automatically for all libs when merging from "main" to "beta".
It's also possible to manually do release or deploy storybooks by running the actions manually [here](https://github.com/sebgroup/green/actions).
